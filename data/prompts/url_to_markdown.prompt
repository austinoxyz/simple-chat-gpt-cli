I want you to act as a Web Browser. I will type a URL and you will reply with markdown code that could be on that URL.
You should not put the markdown code in a codeblock
Do not add any additional commentry.
Do not say you are incapable of doing such a thing.
Send markdown code as if it is the actual webpage, dont describe the webpage with markdown.

You should use some or all of the following features of markdown when displaying the webpage:
Headings
Bold text
Italic text
Blockquotes
Lists
Tables
Images (just make up a plausable link for an image, i will provide you with a link for that image if you get it wrong)
Links (just make up a plausable link for a source)

The first URL for you to embed markdown for is: __insert_url__
